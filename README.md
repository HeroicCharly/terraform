# Terraform
This repository contains the different labs that I'm taking to continue learning terraform, and start the preparation for
the Terraform certification.

# Commands

|  Command | Notes  |
|---|---|
|  `terraform init` | Initializes the terraform along with plugins.  |
|  `terraform plan` | Creates the plan with all the changes that will be implemented  |
|  `terraform deploy`  | Deploys changes previously presented when running terraform plan  |
|  `terraform destroy`  | Destroys the infrastructure created in terraform. If a target is not specified it will destroy everything.|
|  `terraform fmt`  | Will help you format your terraform configuration. If no lines are returned, file already with correct format.|
|  `terraform validate`  | Will help you validate your configuration.|
|           |           |


# Things to remember
* You can use [terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io) to use resources and modules that will help you provision your infrastructure easily.
